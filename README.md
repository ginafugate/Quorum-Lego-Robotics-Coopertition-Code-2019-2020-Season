# Quorum-Lego-Robotics-Coopertition-Code-2019-2020-Season

The Maryland School for the Blind sponsors two First Lego League teams, DOT5UDOGS and 180 Optimum.  As of the 2018-2019 school year, the teams have used Quorum to program their Lego EV3 robot.  This year we are sharing our code in the interest of helping others.  Also, in a spirit of Coopertition we are purposefully sharing working code for the Crane Mission of the 2019-2020 FIrst Lego League season, particularly since First Lego League published EV3 Mindstorms Code, which is inaccessible to our teams and others who are blid or visually impaired or have a print disability.
