# Quorum-Lego-Robotics-Coopertition-Code-2019-2020-Season

The Maryland School for the Blind sponsors two First Lego League (FLL) teams, DOT5UDOGS and 180 Optimum.  As of the 2018-2019 school year, the teams have used Quorum to program their Lego EV3 robot for First Lego League competitions.  

In the spirit of FLL "Coopertition" we are purposefully sharing working code for the Crane Mission of the 2019-2020 FLL season. We are doing this especially since First Lego League published EV3 Mindstorms Code, which is inaccessible to our teams and others who are blind or visually impaired or have a print disability.
